# Fraud-Detection

I am using a Kaagle dataset which  is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data. 

First I performed EDA then feature engineering with the goal of handling categorical values and finding the best features to enhance model efficiency. Then I used XGBoost to build an ML model that can predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
